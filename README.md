# Chalkidiki properties price prediciton
 
The aim of this project for the Machine Learning course at NTUA is to classify whether a property is a good deal or not based on its price and several other features. In order to achieve this classification, a regression model was fitted in the available data and based on its predictions the properties were classified. To better understand the vailable data, several vizualizations were created in Tableau (the workbook is also available).
