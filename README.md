# Chalkidiki properties price prediciton
 
The goal of this project for the Machine Learning course at NTUA is to classify whether a property represents a good deal based on its price and various other features. To accomplish this, a regression model was trained on the available dataset, and the predicted values were used to categorize the properties. To gain deeper insights into the data, several visualizations were created using Tableau (the workbook is provided as well).
